        This 2016 BBC Children in Need video involves Eddie Redmayne being
        connected to various people by GBBO hosts- I mean incompetent phone
        operators, Mel and Sue. It mainly features other things, but there is a
        quick visit to Nonnatus House (at timestamp 1:44), so
        I thought it was worth including.
