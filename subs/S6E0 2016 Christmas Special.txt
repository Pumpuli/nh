MATURE JENNY: Why do we
give presents at Christmas?

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,638
Because, once upon a time,

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,957
a child lay in a manger,

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,799
asking for nothing,

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,393
yet needing so much?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,274
And because three kings

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,000
paid tribute
in the only way they could?

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,717
Perhaps the reason does not matter.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,430
The smiles of those we love
mean more than any ribboned box,

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,509
whether it is offered or received.

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,829
And the most precious gifts
cost nothing

there has been one doctor there,

Hope Clinic is the only medical facility
for a hundred miles.

we have been asked to send

Yes, but he asked me to see

Good afternoon, boys!

778
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,112
My name is Abel.
We've come for the polio vaccination.

779
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,310
I have money.

780
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,914
If I don't have enough for both,
I want my brother to have the injection.

781
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,879
There's no injection, Abel,

782
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,031
it's medicine you swallow
on a sugar lump.

783
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,475
And there's no charge.

Although we do have to add you
to our records,

785
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,834
if you aren't already on our list.

786
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,476
We are not from this place.
I walk eight miles.

No wonder your brother's legs got tired.

788

Matthias cannot walk. He has had polio.

789

That's why I want him
to have the vaccination.

790
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,833
How long ago did Matthias
have polio, Abel?

791
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,439
Two years ago.

792
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,357
Did you learn to speak English
at school?

793
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,795
We learn only handicrafts at school.
Our mother taught me before she died.

794
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,395
Can you feel that?

795
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,831
He feels but he can't move.

796
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,754
That is why we want him
to have the vaccination.

797
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,358
To cure the polio,
like it says on the posters.

798
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,718
You can have the vaccination, Abel.

799
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,035
And there's no harm in giving Matthias
one too.

800
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,669
But there is something
that you need to understand.

804
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,119
Abel, vaccination is to prevent polio.

805
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,429
To stop it from happening.

806
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,914
It is good medicine.

807
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,078

Can't it help him to walk?

812

He was a good walker
before he had polio.

the only thing they had.

things might get better.

817

At least Abel's been vaccinated.

Shelagh, and you know it.

01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,789
Why?

1040
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,710
Because some liver diseases are curable.

1041
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,077
If you would just let
Dr Turner examine you.

1042
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,069
You think I'm arrogant, don't you?

1043
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,790
<i>No. I think you're scared.</i>

1044
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:25,994
And you've been so brave for so long,
and so alone for so long,

1045
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,798
that it's going to take a lot
of courage to admit that.

1046
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,231
Right we'll be starting by dismantling
the current water pipe

1047
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,880
and clearing the tubes
of any clay residue.

1048
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,952
Then we'll re-lay the pipes all the way

1049
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,759
from the new, clean spring
to the Hope Clinic.

1050
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,789
Everyone working will
be paid a daily wage.

1051
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,192
If you have any difficulties,
you're to come to me, Mr Buckle,

1052
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,669
or Mr Muzungulu,
who's been appointed foreman.

1053
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,955
Right!

1054
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,832
If you're feeling unwell, or if your
cough plays up, you let me know.

1055
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,237
DR TURNER: And out.

1056
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,750
(CRIES OUT)

1057
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,879
I don't think it's a tumour.

1058
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,915
I think it's a hepatic abscess.
But it's sizeable.

1059
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,672
We need to get you to the general
hospital in Port Elizabeth.

1060
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,517
No. Not three hours
in an un-sprung truck.

1061
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,750
If it bursts,
I won't survive the journey.

1062
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,840
I may be stubborn, but I'm not a fool.

1063
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,631
And you're a doctor. Which means I'm
listening to what you have to say.

1064
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,589
Likewise.

1065
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,436
Medicine is never about
doing what's easy.

1066
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,477
It's about doing what's essential.

1067
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,592
So what do we do next?

1068
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,158
With your permission,
I'll drain the abscess

1069
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,993
and give you emetine,
to tackle the infection.

1070
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,235
Very well.

1071
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,558
A bit of local anaesthetic,
it'll be drained before you know it.

1072
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,277
No. No anaesthetic.
We've only got what you brought,

1073
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,599
and I'm saving that
for my caesarean ladies.

1074
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:35,516
Those are my terms, Doctor.
Patients first.

1075
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,473
<i>And in this case, I mean mine.
Not yours.</i>

1076
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,356
- God bless.
- Thank you.

1077
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,393
May the Lord bless you and keep you.

1078
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:58,870
<i>I appreciate the sentiment.
Now back to bed, all of you.</i>

1079
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,274
Can't keep my doctor waiting.

1080
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,750
Aspirating.

1081
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:35,430
Dish.

1082
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,752
How much water do we have left?

1083
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:22,431
If you really want to be a good patient,
you'll leave all of that to us.

1084
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,750
Do you know why Mr Starke won't let
the pipe pass over his land?

1085
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:30,715
<i>I assumed it was because...</i>

1086
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,474
Because he hates blacks?

1087
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,279
- Yes.
- No.

1088
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,957
It's because he loved his wife.

1089
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,472
She was younger than him,

1090
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,554
and you never saw a girl look
so pretty on her pedestal.

1091
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,116
And when their firstborn came along,
she went into labour early,

1092
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,080
and they had no time for a transfer
to a private nursing home,

1093
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,480
so they sent for me.

1094
01:04:55,360 --> 01:05:00,116
I delivered her of a four-pound boy
that lived for six days.

1095
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,278
She was too ill to realise
what she'd lost, but Mr Starke wasn't.

1096
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,877
And she survived only 24 hours more.
Puerperal fever.

1097
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:16,750
Has Mr Starke held a grudge against
Hope Clinic all this time?

1098
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:23,470
In his eyes, I transmitted the disease
from my patients to his wife.

1099
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:28,712
When people have no love to live for,

1100
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:33,874
it's so very easy to fill
that void with hate.

1101
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,835
Yes.

1102
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,360
Water is now officially on the ration.

1103
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:53,233
No more washing, it's for
consumption and sterilisation only.

1104
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,390
All right.

1105
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:59,559
Is that the aspirate
from Dr Myra's abscess?

1106
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:01,954
It's definitely amoebic,

1107
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:05,437
and that means the drugs we're using
should be working,

1108
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,431
but she's getting worse.

1109
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,520
Could you be bold
and try a different treatment?

1110
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:12,637
I'm not sure there is one,

1111
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,472
and I've been bold enough already.

1112
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,391
<i>I stuck my neck out
draining the abscess,</i>

1113
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,595
and look where we ended up.

1114
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,999
We haven't "ended up" anywhere yet,
Patrick.

1115
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,195
There's a time and a place for caution,
but not here, and not now.

1116
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,430
And I'm not going to say anything else,

1117
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,397
<i>because I'm afraid
I might speak sharply.</i>

1118
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:34,154
And no matter how high the stakes,
you don't deserve that.

1119
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,799
Good morning, ladies.

1120
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:40,950
ALL: Good morning.

1121
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:44,590
And the Hotel Hope Clinic
is once again open for business.

1122
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,798
All right, Constance?

1123
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,873
<i>I think maybe yes. Maybe no?</i>

1124
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,270
<i>Today I think something might happen.</i>

1125
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:01,200
well, if it does,
you're in the right place.

1126
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,030
Oh.

1127
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,872
Sustenance for the workers.

1128

After which we're collecting water from
the stream to take back to the hospital.

1129
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:16,873
Why didn't you bring the truck?

1130
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,598
BARBARA: Nurse Crane said
we shouldn't waste fuel.

1131
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,310
We won't have to do it for long,
just until the new pipeline's connected.

1132
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,199
That's it, Constance, that's it.

1133
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:36,070
How much longer? One hour, or two?

1134
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,270
A few.

1135
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,998
Come on. Think how long
you've waited for this baby.

Excuse me!

1139
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:59,755
You were right, Shelagh. If we act now,
there's one last thing that we can try.

01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,870
<i>Oh, Patrick, I hope so.</i>

We're going to help you, I promise.

<i>I came as quickly as I could.</i>

1144
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,479
We need to get her to a hospital,
preferably in Port Elizabeth,

1145
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:18,952
and persuade them to give her a drug
called metronidazole. It's new.

1146
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,035
It's still experimental, but I've read
reports on it, and I'm prepared to beg.

1147
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,114
She deserves better than this.

1148
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,752
Don't worry. She'll get the very best
that we can give her.

1149

We're working as fast as we can, Sister.

When will the pipeline
be connected to the tank?

It could take as long as two months.

1156
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:34,593
Two months?
We've barely enough water for two days.

1157
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,158
Without Mr Starke's permission
to put the pipe across his land,

1158
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,074
we have to lay it around his boundary,
which runs for miles.

01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,833

- No. He just refuses.

The cervix is oedematous,
and the head's very high.

- Narrow pelvis?
- Very.

- Lucky her.

I have spoken with Dr Myra

towards Hope Clinic are...

I have generally been quite
a fortunate woman, Mr Starke.

1181
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,080
I've experienced little
in the way of loss.

Mr Starke, if your wife did die
because of bacterial infection,

1208
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:25,589
you could help prevent that happening
to any other mother.

1209
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:30,356
All you have to do is to stop blaming
Dr Myra and her black patients

1211
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,038
You ask a great deal of a man

Believe me,

1216
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,954
a clean water supply to the hospital
would be a better memorial to your wife

1217

are not her face,

Constance needs a caesarean section.

Then we have no choice.
We have to operate ourselves.

to behave yourself.</i>

1375
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:38,039
Because until you're fully recovered,
Dr Myra, I'm in charge.

1376
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,680
Oh! Go on, off the garden.
Go on, off!

1377
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,750
Right.

1378
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,870
Oh, that's nice.
Now just get a bit closer.

1379
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,355

flourished long after the visitors
from Nonnatus said goodbye.

1385
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,392
But though they had given their labour
and their love,

1386
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,835
they also took, and they learned.

1387
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:20,909
And they went home wiser, enriched

1388
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,751
in ways that they could not count.
